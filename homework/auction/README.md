# Simple Open Auction

The general idea of the following auction program is that everyone can 
send their bids during a bidding period. The bids already include sending 
money/sols in order to bind the bidders to their bid. If the highest bid is raised, 
the previously highest bidder can claim her/his money back at the end of an auction. 
After the end of the bidding period, the program has to be called manually for 
the beneficiary to receive their money.
