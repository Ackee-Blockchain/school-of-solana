# 6. Lecture - Frontend for Solana Programs

This week's lecture focuses on teaching you how to build a simple frontend for your dApp.

The repository contains the source code for both the Anchor program as well as the frontend of the bank example created during the lecture.

**The Anchor program is already deployed**, so you can interact with it by simply starting the frontend and connecting your hot wallet. Make sure your wallet is set to **devnet** mode.

>[!TIP]
>### Try Deploying the Program Yourself!
>You will need to update the program ID as demonstrated at the start of the lecture. The current program ID is already in use.

## Setup

To set up the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the frontend with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the frontend is running, it will be available at http://localhost:3000/.
