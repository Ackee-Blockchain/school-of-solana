### Configure CLI

> If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run these commands

1. Set CLI config url to localhost cluster

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

2. Create CLI Keypair

If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

### Start local Solana cluster

This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Start a local Solana cluster:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

> **Note**: You may need to do some [system tuning](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#system-tuning) (and restart your computer) to get the validator to run

Listen to transaction logs:

```bash
solana logs
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

There is both a Rust and C version of the on-chain program, whichever is built
last will be the one used when running the example.

```bash
npm run build:program-rust
```

### Deploy the on-chain program

```bash
solana program deploy dist/program/counter.so
```

### Run the JavaScript client

```bash
npm run start
```
